First things first:
1. Collect data for the corpus (some sort of steps and manual data so that my model can know what it needs to build in the future)
2. Collect some high standard SOP's so that my model can learn what needs to be done.
3. Need to get some resume data so that my problem becomes that I need to get a SOP as output when resume is feeded to the network.
