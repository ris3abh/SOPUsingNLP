Apr 28 2022 POSTED IN Home  NEWS  Current News Writing a killer Statement of Purpose By Ivan Rosa de Siqueira Learn more about this important component of grad school applications and how you can write an effective SOP Most graduate programs at Rice and in the United States broadly will require applicants to submit a Statement of Purpose SOP as part of the application process In my opinion the main objective of the admissions committee when asking for the SOP is very clear to get to know you better and understand your motivations to go to graduate school Even though the SOP is only one of the many components of the application package  which will typically include other important documents such as CV transcripts recommendation letters etc  the SOP will probably be your only opportunity of talking writing actually about yourself with your own words CV and transcripts are documents that are somewhat official and bring a list of achievements and accomplishments throughout your career recommendation letters are written by others and bring an outer perspective of yourself as a potential graduatelevel researcher Conversely the SOP should provide the committee with information that cannot be explicitly found elsewhere information that only you can express accurately That being said the SOP is a central component of any application process to graduate school There are many different ways of constructing a good SOP the first step however should always be the same doublecheck the instructions provided by the program and what points should be addressed in your essay For instance the following text was adapted from Rices Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering1 A statement of purpose should address the following questions Why do you want to obtain a degree in Chemical Engineering Why are you interested in Rice and in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Rice What relevant experiences do you have in research academics andor prior jobs Why do you believe you will be successful in either a thesis or nonthesis degree graduate program What would you like to do after completing your degree and what are your longterm career goals Overall the SOP should bring an overview of your academic and professional trajectories focusing on 1 why you are interested in that graduate program 2 what are your academic professional and researchextracurricular experiences 3 how these experiences make you an ideal candidate for that program and 4 what are your plans after completing your degree These are the general guidelines followed by most graduate programs in STEM at least Before start the actual writing I believe you should invest some time in making a detailed timeline of your academicprofessional life thus far Make sure you highlight the main points that marked your path since the beginning of your education My understanding is that this requires a lot of reflection and selfknowledge however I can assure this exercise will be very useful to help you track events chronologically throughout your text I now draft the structure of what I consider a good SOP This is very general make sure you adapt the actual content to your reality and incorporate some other stylistic changes Starting an SOP can be very challenging A reasonable strategy consists of delivering a general welcome card trying to touch upon some of the points highlighted in the program instructions andor providing the committee with any particular piece of information that distinguishes you from others Introduce yourself explain why you want to go to graduate school in that field why you want to join that program and what you want to do after graduation and why a graduate degree from that program is important to achieve your goals Be brief here you have the whole SOP to detail and expand on these introductory comments This initial part should be one paragraph Then describe your academic path starting from when you think you had the first trigger to do research and go to graduate school You can explore experiences in high school scientific fairs internships academic competitions etc college andor Masters research experiences publications talks and presentations in conferences TA positions etc and prior jobs internships consultancies services etc The chief point here is the following do not limit yourself to a simple list of facts otherwise your SOP will essentially become an extended version of your CV You do not want that Instead show what you learned and how you improved with these experiences Provide examples of how you can work independently collaborate with others think critically communicate your results etc  these are fundamental skills in graduate school Make sure you can align these points with the specifics of the program you are applying to You obviously want to show a solid background in your field but more importantly you want to demonstrate that you have the necessary skillset and mindset to thrive in graduate school with the support of faculty and resources that program offers This usually becomes two paragraphs Start being more specific about the research lines the program offers Show evidence that you did your homework and studied the program in depth Describe your interest in two to three faculty members and their labs show you understand their research and recent works show motivation to work in their groups based on your previous experiences explain what you will add skills ideas etc to their current research In summary answer the question What do you bring to the table And just to complement if you contacted faculty before submitting your application2 make sure you mention that in your SOP because that professor might not be on the committee that year This is one paragraph To conclude work on a short paragraph that summarizes your story and reiterates that going to graduate school and joining that program are key steps in your life plans and research career goals Continuing be truthful and original and always avoid clichs Describe your skills and abilities in detail and make sure you provide the committee with examples of past research works that support your claims with concrete evidence More importantly show how much the program will benefit from having you as a student Never try to fit your story into a dream candidate profile this profile does not exist and attempts to do this will be easily identified by the committee Do not hide adversities you have eventually gone through both personal and academic instead describe these problems and explain how you overcame them what you learned from them and how they contributed to who you are today Resilience when dealing with problems motivation to overcome challenges and learning from mistakes will be essential in graduate school Make sure the committee knows you know that Writing an SOP is extremely timeconsuming I recommend you start working on yours as soon as you have decided what programs you will be applying to You will likely need to write many many versions of your SOP until they converge to a final satisfactory result Length and formatting can change depending on program requirements In general I recommend 2 pages with editing that will ease the reading eg Arial or Calibri font 12 spacing 152 standard paragraphs and margins etc Some programs might be a bit more demanding and determine a maximum number of words eg 500 or 1000 Expressing ideas clearly and concisely is key in graduate school use the SOP to demonstrate you master this skill In contrast to other languages such as Brazilian Portuguese I am Brazilian English allows for a very direct and effective writing communication Go straight to the points you want to highlight and do not waste space sometimes precious with sentences that do not add relevant information about yourself as a future graduate student The committee will have hundreds of SOP to go through do not make yours boring The committee will know if you are an international student and the committee members will not expect to read an essay written by Shakespeare Be careful with your writing and avoid naive mistakes but do not spend too much energy trying to improve your vocabulary beyond what you are comfortable working with Avoid too many adjectives and adverbs use short direct sentences in an active voice If possible you might want to ask some friends to review your SOP However be careful First make sure your reviewers are aware of the SOP overall goal in the application process and are sufficiently proficient in written English second do not ask many people for feedback because it might become unfeasible to incorporate so many different suggestions in a single text Finally keep in mind that you know your story better than anyone else and that the SOP should bring your own perspective about yourself 1 Notice that this department offers two different graduate programs a PhD program which requires a thesis and Professional Masters program which does not require a thesis Both require an SOP as part of the application process 2 Contacting faculty members potential research advisors in advance is another important step of the application process Review the post here for some tips Acknowledgements I am very thankful to the comments and suggestions by Igor Cunha Queens University Rassa Dantas

a Statement of Purpose for Graduate School By Shayna Joubert  October 5 2020 Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Linkedin Congrats Youve chosen a graduate program read up on tips for applying to grad school and even wrote a focused grad school resum But if youre like many students youve left the most daunting part of the application process for lastwriting a statement of purpose The good news is the task doesnt have to feel so overwhelming as long as you break the process down into simple actionable steps Below learn how to write a strong unique statement of purpose that will impress admissions committees and increase your chances of getting into your dream school What is a statement of purpose A statement of purpose SOP sometimes referred to as a personal statement is a critical piece of a graduate school application that tells admissions committees who you are what your academic and professional interests are and how youll add value to the graduate program youre applying to Jared Pierce associate director of enrollment services at Northeastern University says a strong statement of purpose can be the deciding factor in a graduate students admission Your statement of purpose is where you tell your story about who you are and why you deserve to be a part of the universitys community It gives the admissions committee the chance to get to know you and understand how youll add value to the classroom he says How long is a statement of purpose A statement of purpose should be between 500 and 1000 words Pierce says noting that it should typically not exceed a single page He advises that students use a traditional font at a readable size 11 or 12pt and leave enough whitespace in the margins to make the statement easytoread Make sure to doublespace the statement if the university has requested it he adds Interested in learning more about Northeasterns graduate programs Get your questions answered by our enrollment team REQUEST INFORMATION How to Write a Statement of Purpose A StepbyStep Guide Now that you understand how to format a statement of purpose you can begin drafting your own Getting started can feel daunting but Pierce suggests making the process more manageable by breaking down the writing process into four easy steps 1 Brainstorm your ideas First he says try to reframe the task at hand and get excited for the opportunity to write your statement of purpose He explains Throughout the application process youre afforded few opportunities to address the committee directly Here is your chance to truly speak directly to them Each student arrives at this process with a unique story including prior jobs volunteer experience or undergraduate studies Think about what makes you you and start outlining When writing your statement of purpose he suggests asking yourself these key questions Why do I want this degree What are my expectations for this degree What courses or program features excite me the most Where do I want this degree to take me professionally and personally How will my unique professional and personal experiences add value to the program Jot these responses down to get your initial thoughts on paper This will act as your starting point that youll use to create an outline and your first draft 2 Develop an outline Next youll want to take the ideas that youve identified during the brainstorming process and plug them into an outline that will guide your writing An effective outline for your statement of purpose might look something like this INTRODUCTION An attentiongrabbing hook A brief introduction of yourself and your background as it relates to your motivation behind applying to graduate school BODY Your relevant experience and accomplishments that relate to the field Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 Your professional goals as they relate to the program youre applying to Why youre interested in the specific school and what you can bring to the table CONCLUSION A brief summary of the information presented in the body that emphasizes your qualifications and compatibility with the school An outline like the one above will give you a roadmap to follow so that your statement of purpose is wellorganized and concise 3 Write the first draft Your statement of purpose should communicate who you are and why you are interested in a particular program but it also needs to be positioned in a way that differentiates you from other applicants Admissions professionals already have your transcripts resum and test scores the statement of purpose is your chance to tell your story in your own words When you begin drafting content make sure to Provide insight into what drives you whether thats professional advancement personal growth or both Demonstrate your interest in the school by addressing the unique features of the program that interest you most For Northeastern he says maybe its experiential learning youre excited to tackle realworld projects in your desired industry Or perhaps its learning from faculty who are experts in your field of study Be yourself It helps to keep your audience in mind while writing but dont forget to let your personality shine through Its important to be authentic when writing your statement to show the admissions committee who you are and why your unique perspective will add value to the program 4 Edit and refine your work Before you submit your statement of purpose Make sure youve followed all directions thoroughly including requirements about margins spacing and font size Proofread carefully for grammar spelling and punctuation Remember that a statement of purpose should be between 500 and 1000 words If youve written far more than this read through your statement again and edit for clarity and conciseness Less is often more articulate your main points strongly and get rid of any clutter Walk away and come back later with a fresh set of eyes Sometimes your best ideas come when youre not sitting and staring at your computer Ask someone you trust to read your statement before you submit it Making a Lasting Impression Your statement of purpose can leave a lasting impression if done well Pierce says It provides you with the opportunity to highlight your unique background and skills so that admissions professionals understand why youre the ideal candidate for the program that youre applying to If nothing else stay focused on what you uniquely bring to the classroom the program and the campus community If you do that youll excel To learn more tricks and tips for submitting an impressive

Academic Statement of Purpose Writing Your Academic Statement of Purpose What is it Each applicant must submit an academic statement of purpose ASOP The ASOP is one of your primary opportunities to help the admissions committee understand your academic objectives and determine if you are a good match for the program you are applying to The goal of this document is to impress upon the admissions committee that you have a solid background and experience in your area of interest and that you have the potential to be successful in graduate study The ASOP is also a place if necessary where you can and should address any blemishes gaps or weaknesses in your academic record In these situations you will want to be honest but brief It is best to turn negatives into positives by focusing on how you overcame obstacles remained persistent in the pursuit of your goals and showed resilience Share what you learned from the particular experience and how it led you to become a better researcherscholarperson etc Why is it important The ASOP is one of the most important pieces of your graduate school application because it Gives the reviewers an understanding of your academic background and interests Allows you to illustrate in your own words what sets you apart from other applicants Helps them determine if you are a good match for the program to which you are applying Shows your communication style and ability Information to Include Introduce yourself and your academic interests Provide simple background information on your area of interest and how it became of particular interest to you Here you can also share with them how and why you decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field Describe your academic background preparation and training Skills you have learned from academic lab or research experiences eg undergraduate coursework research opportunities scholarly writings jobs in the field presentations etc Whenever possible give specific examples and illustrate the points you are making dont just simply tell them Research you conducted  project title or focus research mentor your specific role what you learned and the outcome If there were challenges dont be afraid to mention what you learned from them This shows persistence and resilience in the face of adversity these are also things they are looking for Important papers or thesis project you completed as well as anything scholarly beyond your academic degree requirements Relevant work or internship experience as related to the field you are applying to Show them you are making an informed decision Indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in the discipline and are aware of research trends Show them that you have thoroughly researched the program its faculty and research focus areas and why you are applying to this program specifically This will help you write a more informed essay that is relatable to the faculty who will be reviewing your application Describe why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you If there are specific faculty you are interested in working with check the programs ASOP instructions and determine how best to mention this in your essay Some programs require you to name a professors with whom you would like to work Are there any aspects of the program that are of particular interest to you immersion program opportunities for collaboration with others outside of the institution research centers associated with the program etc Include information that is important to you outside of the program  supportive environment for firstyear students access to amazing literary resources opportunities to participate in professionalcareer development programming etc Professional goals  you may wish to outline what you plan to do after you complete the program as a way of underscoring the importance of your choice to pursue graduate study Share any extracurricular opportunities you have had that show leadership ability to work with a diverse group of people teaching skills etc Research degree applicants should identify specific faculty members whose research interests align with your own interests Important Things to Remember Details Pay attention and follow instructions very carefully  every program is different and some have specific itemstopics they want you to address Unless otherwise noted this is an academically focused essay not necessarily a personal essay You will likely add some personal details here and there but be sure to keep the focus on your academic background and future potential Proofread and pay close attention to details  they really matter Have others from a variety of perspectives read your essay before you submit it  they should be looking at it in terms of content style and grammar Remember those outside of your field can provide you with valuable perspective and feedback Keep in mind that you can continue editing your ASOP after you have submitted it to programs with earlier deadlines Length Format and Tone Unless otherwise noted one to two pages in a standard font and size is typical Include your full name and proposed program of study at the top of each page  if faculty are not reading an electronic version of your essay pages can become separated Write with confidence and in an active voice  doing this makes your sentences clear and less wordycomplicated Language should be positive and focused Since faculty are the ones reviewing your application it is fine to use disciplinespecific terminology tone and style in your ASOP Final Checklist Have you Described your academic background in enough detail to show your experience and preparedness in the field Shown that you are a good fit for the program you are applying to Defined why you want a graduate degree in this field Demonstrated that you are selfmotivated persistent competent and have the skills necessary to be successful in graduate school Followed the ASOP instructions as defined by the program you are applying to Polished proofread and had others
